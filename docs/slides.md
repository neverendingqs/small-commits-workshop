# Small Commits in Practice: A Hands-on Workshop

Carl Pacey and Mark Tse

---

# Introduction

---

# Agenda

* Goals
* Quick refresher on techniques
* Exercise 1: Breaking up a pull request (~45 minutes)
* Break (~10 minutes)
* Exercise 2: Plan implementing a feature using small commits (~45 minutes)

---

# Goals

---

# Techniques

* Add a new class, method, property, etc
  * Test it, but don't use it
* Add new tests to existing code
* Refactor existing code
  * Specifically to make your next change easier, safer, or smaller
  * Try to limit or isolate test changes
  * Try to avoid (or isolate) functional changes
* Functional changes are smaller after you make the above non-functional changes first

---

# Exercise 1: Breaking up a pull request

* The app currently supports a "get all users" route
  * `small-commits-workshop/SmallCommitsWorkshop/Controllers/UsersController.cs`
* The `users/bigpr` branch does the following:
  * Adds GET single user
  * Adds POST user, which creates or updates
  * Adds DELETE user
  * Adds an index on User.Id
  * Adds a new property User.IsActive
  * Refactors tests
* Tasks:
  * Fork the repository
    (https://github.com/neverendingqs/small-commits-workshop)
  * Using `users/bigpr`, break up the code into smaller commits
      * You can view the changes at
        https://github.com/neverendingqs/small-commits-workshop/pull/13
  * For each commit, create a pull request onto `<user>/master`
    * Either add Carl, Mark, or another person in the workshop as your reviewer
  * Continue until your `<user>/master` branch is functionally similar to
    `users/bigpr`

# Exercise 2: Let's add a new feature

* You're hopefully familiar with Users after Exercise #1.
* You may have noticed that the app already supports `/fizzbuzz/{number}`.
* Now we're going to expand the `/fizzbuzz` functionality to include user information.

# Exercise 2: Wait, WTF is FizzBuzz?

[content goes here]

---

# Exercise 2: Best route ever

We want to add the following route:

`/fizzbuzz/{number}/users/{userId}`

This route will return a modified FizzBuzz:

1. Instead of "Fizz", this route will use the user's UserName.
1. Instead of "Buzz", this route will use a new user property, BuzzWord.

---

# Exercise 2: Specification by Example

```http
GET /users/1045
```

```json
{
  "id": 1045,
  "userName": "cpacey",
  "isActive": true,
  "buzzWord": "isawesome"
}
```

| `GET` |      Result      |
|:----------|:-------------|
| `/fizzbuzz/2/users/1045` | `2` |
| `/fizzbuzz/6/users/1045` | `cpacey` |
| `/fizzbuzz/10/users/1045` | `isawesome` |
| `/fizzbuzz/15/users/1045` | `cpaceyisawesome` |
